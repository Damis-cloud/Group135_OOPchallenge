# This is a simple pet simulator program that allows users to create a pet and interact with it.
# The user can feed the pet, play with it, teach it tricks, and check its status.
# The program uses a class to represent the pet and its attributes, and it provides a simple text-based interface for user interaction.
# The program is designed to be easy to use and understand, making it suitable for beginners in programming.
# The program is written in Python and uses basic programming concepts such as classes, methods, and user input.
# The program is designed to be run in a terminal or command prompt, and it provides clear instructions for the user to follow.
